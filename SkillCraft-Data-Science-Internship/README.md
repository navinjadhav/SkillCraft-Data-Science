# SkillCraft Data Science — Internship Work

This repository contains the tasks I worked on during my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal of this work was to build a strong foundation in data analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning through hands-on practice.

All tasks are designed to run **offline**, and the required datasets are included in the repository so anyone can reproduce the results easily.

## 📌 What’s Included

- **Task 01 — Data Visualization**  
  Created simple histograms and bar charts to understand age-based data distributions.

- **Task 02 — Titanic Data Analysis (Offline)**  
  Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, handled missing values, and compared important features to extract insights.

- **Task 03 — Decision Tree Classification**  
  Built and evaluated a decision tree model and explored feature importance to understand how the model makes decisions.

- **Task 04 — Traffic Accident Analysis**  
  Analyzed traffic accident data to identify patterns based on time, day of the week, and weather conditions.

> Note: Some datasets are **synthetic learning datasets**, created to keep the project self-contained and suitable for offline practice.
